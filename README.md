# ðŸŒ¤ Weather App â€“ Flask + OpenWeatherMap API  

## ðŸ“Œ Objective  
The objective of this project is to develop a **web-based Weather Application** using **Python Flask** that can display real-time weather details for any city by integrating with the **OpenWeatherMap API**. This project was completed as part of **Task 3** during my Python Development Internship at **Oasis Infobytes**.

## ðŸ”„ Steps Performed  
1. **Set up Flask Project** â€“ Created a Flask application to handle routes and render templates.  
2. **Integrated OpenWeatherMap API** â€“ Registered for an API key and configured API requests to fetch weather data.  
3. **Processed API Response** â€“ Extracted temperature, humidity, and weather conditions from JSON data.  
4. **Built Frontend Template** â€“ Designed an HTML page (`index.html`) for users to input city names and view weather results.  
5. **Tested Functionality** â€“ Verified the app by searching multiple cities and checking for correct real-time data.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python** â€“ Core programming language  
- **Flask** â€“ Web framework for building the application  
- **Requests** â€“ Python library for making API calls  
- **HTML / CSS** â€“ Frontend design for the UI  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** â€“ Source for real-time weather data  

---

## âœ… Outcome  
- Successfully developed a **Weather App** capable of fetching **real-time weather information** for any city worldwide.  
- Displays **temperature (Â°C)**, **humidity (%)**, and **weather condition** in a clean and user-friendly format.  
- Improved understanding of **REST API integration** and **Flask-based web application development**.
